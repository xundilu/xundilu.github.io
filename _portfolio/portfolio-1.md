Concept: This design focuses on a healthy leisure approach and reduces stress by allowing users to move when playing mobile games. The traditional mobile game Fruit Ninja sets finger swipes as the primary interaction mode; Prototype I and Prototype II focus on using a sensor handle that replaces fingers in the game. Prototype III incorporates XR technology based on previous concepts; users need to wave to cut the fruits in the virtual scene to get the score.

Input: sensor displacement, double tap.  
Output: movement of the fruit knife, indicator light on the handle, crash sound.
