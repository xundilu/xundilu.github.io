Overview: The website is expected to serve as a platform for information and access portal for 
different user groups. This website will provide the basic functions of an official website through five 
separate pages: Homepage, About page, Service page, Team page, Contact page. The company name will 
be the University of Queensland Construction Company for the moment. This can be changed by the user 
as required.

Target audience: The target audience includes individual or organisational clients, job seekers, journalists, competitors and random visitors. Their demand is mainly for construction project 
design, construction, consulting and other services. Some industry and company information will also be 
of interest. Our main strategy is to present the background of the company (history, projects) and provide 
information to attract users to contact us in order to obtain orders
