Education
======
* B.Eng. in University of Nottingham Ningbo China, 2021

Research experience
======
* January 2021: Bachelor's Thesis Project
  * Topic: Mobility as a Service (MaaS)
  * Concept: Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a new concept of traffic management and 
  service, which focuses on the user instead of the infrastructure and provides point-to-point on demand travel services. In Brisbane, ODIN PASS is a typical pilot project regarding MaaS. 
  * Work: I wrote a paper to analyze the current development trend of MaaS in China.

* August 2020: Research Intern
  * Topic: Soil stabilization and numerical simulation 
  * Content: This research analyses the stress distribution within the subgrade under cyclic train loading. Therefore, experiments will simulate cyclic train loading and achieve a strain curve with time using a hollow cylinder apparatus (HCA).

  * Work: I participated in collecting soil samples on-site and making specimens. 
  
* January 2019: Research Volunteer
  * Topic: Fiber motar and reinforced concrete
  * Content: This research aims to explore the impact of adding different types of fibres (micro and fine) on the strength of fibre-reinforced concrete.
  * Work: I made ten groups of concrete specimens and participated in the compression test and flexural test.

Project experience
======
* Building Information Modeling (BIM) Concrete Design Project
  * Content: In this project, our team designed a conference centre hotel, applying the concept of Building Information Modeling (BIM) to the planning, designing, construction, and operation of the project.
  * Work: I was responsible for the structural design of the alternative scheme, part of the architectural design, and BIM coordination work.

  * Work: In this project, I collaborated with team members to make a glued laminated timber bridge model (1-meter span) that bore a weight of 67.5kg in load testing.
