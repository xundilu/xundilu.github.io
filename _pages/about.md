I’m a final year graduate student in Information Technology at the University Of Queensland (UQ). 

❤️ My interests lie in Virtual Reality (VR), User Experience (UX) Design, Front End Development. 

👨‍🏭 I received my B.Eng. Degree in Civil Engineering at University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC).

📧 Communicating with different people is enjoyable for me; as it feels like experiencing the lives of others.

I have some research and coursework experience in both Information Technology and Civil Engineering.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. 

Section B.2
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks).
